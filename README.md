# SSC Compiler

A simple pseudocode compiler for A-level and O-level students, enabling them to run their code with essential features.

## 🎯 Goals

- **Create a simple pseudocode compiler** to help A-level and O-level students run their code.
- Implement basic programming constructs like:
  - Functions
  - Input/Output
  - Loops (While, For)
  - Conditional Statements (If, Repeat)
  - Logical Operators
- Focus on simplicity and ease of use for educational purposes.
  
## 🎉 Achievements

- Developed a working pseudocode compiler that can execute basic pseudocode.
- Successfully integrated key features like loops, conditionals, and basic logical operations.
- The compiler is functional and enables students to run pseudocode directly with the provided constructs.
- The system is modular, with clear separation of concerns (lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation).

## ❌ Not Included

- Classes
- User-defined data types
- String operators
